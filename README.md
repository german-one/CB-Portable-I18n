## **Internationalization File For Code::Blocks Portable Launcher**  

The sole purpose of the XML file in this repository is to provide translations for the GUI elements of a Code::Blocks launcher script that I provided in an external guide:  
[English version](https://administrator.de/en/codeblocks-portable-with-mingw-32-and-64-bit-on-windows-8746519955.html)  
[German version](https://administrator.de/tutorial/codeblocks-portable-mit-mingw-32-und-64-bit-unter-windows-12183097108.html)

Users are welcome to contribute their translation strings in a pull request or even in the linked forum threads.
